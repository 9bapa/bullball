Prompt:

Create a square, meme-heavy sticker-style illustration of the Bull Rhun mascot — a cute but unhinged chibi bull that screams crypto meme culture and pure bull-run chaos.

The bull should have:
	•	An oversized head and tiny body
	•	Huge expressive eyes (slightly crazy, excited, or degen-coded)
	•	A big goofy grin or smug smirk like it just front-ran the market
	•	Exaggerated glowing horns that feel dangerous despite the cuteness

Pose ideas:
	•	Bull holding an overflowing crypto bag
	•	Bull flexing or pointing upward
	•	Bull mid-bounce like it just saw a green candle

Art style:
Loud, bold meme sticker art — thick outlines, saturated colors, punchy contrast, simplified shapes, and expressive cartoon exaggeration. Keep it intentionally playful and chaotic, but still clean and polished enough to feel premium.

Background:
	•	Bright gradient, explosive comic-style burst, or abstract energy shapes
	•	High contrast so the character pops instantly
	•	Add a thick white or light sticker outline around the bull

Text Header:
At the top, include “BullRhun”
	•	“Bull” in bold, chunky meme lettering
	•	“Rhun” italicized, slanted forward to suggest speed and momentum
	•	Typography should feel playful, loud, and crypto-native (not corporate)

Vibe:
	•	Maximum meme energy
	•	Degens will instantly recognize it
	•	Feels like a Telegram sticker, Twitter PFP, and hoodie graphic all at once
	•	Cute, chaotic, confident, and slightly dangerous

Output:
Square format, ultra-high resolution, sticker-ready, instantly viral crypto meme mascot.
